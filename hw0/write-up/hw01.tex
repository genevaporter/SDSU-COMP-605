\section*{Algorithm Time Values}

For measuring run times for each scheme, I ran each algorithm 100 times and summed the resulting time measurements. From this I was able to take the average and therefore provide a reasonably accurate estimate of the optimization effects.

        ~ & ijk-form & jki-form \\ \hline
         No optimization (-O0 flag)&  ~ & ~\\ \hline
         With optimization (-O3 flag)& ~ & ~ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
